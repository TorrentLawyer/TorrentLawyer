My name is Rob Cashman (https://www.torrentlawyer.com/about-rob-cashman-torrentlawyer/), and I am the owner of the Cashman Law Firm, PLLC.  I am also the author of the TorrentLawyer blog.

For the past 12 years almost on a daily basis, our law firm has been tracking and reporting on the evolution on bittorrent-based copyright infringement lawsuits.  The copyright holders who have been filing these lawsuits are called "copyright trolls" because they are using the U.S. copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a weapon -- NOT to enforce their copyrights to stop infringement, but to MONETIZE their copyrights using the government and the court system to punish and push accused defendants to pay substantial settlement fees.  

The purpose of our websites are to educate our readers with valuable content we are privy to because we watch these cases daily.  We represent clients in these copyright infringement lawsuits daily, and we see the trends of what exactly is going on, how to handle these lawsuits, and where these lawsuits are likely headed.

The purpose of the GitHub pages are to manage articles and errors on both the TorrentLawyer blog (https://www.torrentlawyer.com) and the Cashman Law Firm PLLC https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com websites.

The Cashman Law Firm PLLC websites were created in 2010 when we started the law firm.  The law firm's website originally was meant just to provide an introduction to the law firm and to provide broad, but detailed in-depth articles on the areas of law in which our law firm represented clients.  The TorrentLawyer blog was created specifically to deal with the copyright troll problem that evolved in the federal courts after the MPAA / RIAA / Grokster / Napster lawsuits prior to 2010.  In short, copyright holders learned that they could sue individual downloaders for $150,000 per instance of infringement by using the U.S. copyright laws to file copyright infringement lawsuits in federal courts.  However, instead of looking for $150,000 judgements, the copyright holders (copyright trolls) realized that they can use the federal courts to solocit (force) a large settlement payment in return for the release of an accused defendant from the lawsuit.

We also have other websites, e.g., https://www.patentlicense.org (our law firm also helps clients negotiate patent transfers and resolve patent licensing issues), along with https://www.cashmanip.com (which served as a blog for patent litigation and patent troll topics).  Prior to taking on the "copyright trolling" issue, our law firm was knee-deep in the patent troll issue (which is still around today, but the cases are quite fewer and more complicated than the copyright infringement cases).

Our websites have gone through many revisions over the years, including template changes, movement from one hosting service to another, implementing free Wordpress.org, then moving to a private paid hosting service using Wordpress.com. With this came Wordpress plug-ins, data management issues, security breaches, and more.

Until now, it was me, my small team, and those we hired out on a project-by-project basis to fix problems as they arose. However, other than searching through the website regularly to find errors, I relied on website visitors to let me know when something on the website broke or stopped working.

The purpose of this project is to hopefully organize the website issues that pop up. I will have my team use this to point out errors on the site that they find, and hopefully you (my readers) will do the same.

Obviously the website is a business website meant to bring business to the law firm, but it is also an educational website meant to provide you good and useful content. I am hoping this will be enough of a reason to decide to provide me feedback when something doesn't work.

Other than finding "broken things" (e.g., web forms that don't work, or buttons that don't click), if you have any suggestions for improving the website -- either in the site structure, the navigation (to make it easy to find articles), or in the theme features or layout itself, please let me know.

Warm regards, Rob Cashman Owner of the Cashman Law Firm, PLLC
